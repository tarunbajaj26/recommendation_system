Develop awareness and training material for responsible disposal of e-waste,Published,Public,Social Development,Vishal Peripherals,Develop training and awareness material for the end consumers of IT electronic products about sustainable e-waste management. ,Waste Management Specialist,Intermediate,30,PowerPoint,1,"Vishal Peripherals is a leading IT retail store in Hyderabad. The store services multiple businesses and individuals who purchase gadgets of all shapes and sizes, from power cords to printers from this store. They are preferred retail partners of over 200+ electronic brands and are among the top 5 retailers in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
IT retailers can potentially play a key role in awareness of e-waste management as they work closely with producer companies (who are mandated by law to finance and facilitate management of e-waste) and customers (who dispose e-waste in some manner or another). An IT retailer can influence both parties to follow sustainable e-waste practices.","E-waste management systems,Methods of reducing e-waste,Behavior change communication",3,"According to a 2020 report by the Central Pollution Control Board, India generated 1,014,961 tonnes of e-waste in FY 2019-2020 – up 32% from FY 2018-2019. Of this, the report found that only 3.6% and 10% were actually collected in the country in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Where did the rest of the waste go? Most e-waste in India ends up in landfills where it is collected by rag pickers who sell it in the informal waste processing sector. E-waste does not belong in the landfill as it contaminates the soil as well as ground water. Moreover, informal waste processing units do not have the facilities required to safely process e-waste. They are also not able to maximise the resource recovery from e-waste. The only way to sustainably manage e-waste is to work together with producers (who can use repurposed materials from e-waste) and consumers (who can dispose of e-waste with formal units).","Social sector research,Behaviour change communication,Waste management",3,Waste Management,1,1,Develop awareness and training material for responsible disposal of e-waste by consumers,"Research report on best practices of e-waste management,Awareness material for customers to responsible dispose of e-waste
